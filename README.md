This is an card collection app designed for the users to search for specific card, browse cards, see card prices and add cards into collections for remembering. 

The functions Im planning on having in the app are:
Rendering new page content when clicking on buttons and searching for cards.
One or more searchbars linked to an API to find specific cards.
A renderer that takes images for an API of most trending cards and making several visible.
A slideshow where the user can see which cards they have viewed recently (limited to a set number of cards and only when logged in).
A function that reads and edits from a database.
A function that creates the collections on the collections page.
